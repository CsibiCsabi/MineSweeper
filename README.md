# MineSweeper
This is a "simple" minesweeper game built in Flutter. I did it all on my own. I think it helped me develop a better understanding of Flutter. I hope you like it!


## How to experience it yourself
If you want to try this project, you must have Flutter installed on your PC or an online Flutter compiler. You only need the lib folder for this one. Just paste the folder instead of the existing one, and it should work! If you have any recommendations or problems, don't be afraid to tell me!
